<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">💫 Verse 1</span></h3>
<p>The ultimate life flows from one sacred principle: cause no unnecessary harm to any conscious being. This simple truth guides every decision, relationship, and action toward creating more joy and less suffering in the world.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">✨ Verse 2</span></h3>

</div>

<div class="verse">

<div class="verse">

<div class="verse">

<div class="verse">

</div>

<div class="verse">
<h3><span class="verse-number">💡 Verse 10</span></h3>
